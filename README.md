🎬 Stream Detector ProThe ultimate Chrome extension for developers, researchers, and power-users to uncover and capture direct video stream URLs from any website.Stream Detector Pro goes beyond simple link grabbing. It employs a multi-layered detection strategy, including advanced, site-specific deep scanners for tough-to-crack platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.✨ Key FeaturesStream Detector Pro uses three distinct methods working in harmony to find every possible video stream on a page.1.  passive Network ScanningAlways On: Automatically listens to network traffic in the background.Efficient: Captures .mp4, .m3u8, .mpd, .webm, and other stream formats as they are requested by the page.Metadata Rich: Fetches available metadata like file size directly from the network headers.2. On-Page HTML ScanningInstant Detection: Scans the page's HTML for <video> tags and their sources as soon as the page loads.Dynamic Content Ready: Uses a MutationObserver to detect videos that are added to the page dynamically (e.g., through infinite scrolling).3. 🚀 Advanced Deep ScannersThis is the core power of the extension. For complex sites that hide their video sources, a targeted deep scanner can be manually triggered.YouTube:Goes beyond public APIs to parse the internal ytInitialPlayerResponse object.Includes a signature deciphering engine to unlock and access the highest-quality video and audio streams that are normally protected.Facebook:Intelligently parses embedded GraphQL data structures within the page's source.Reliably extracts both SD and HD playable_url links from video posts and reels.Instagram:Pinpoints and decodes the JSON data embedded within post and reel pages.Extracts multiple video_versions with different resolutions.🛠️ InstallationSince this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you need to install it manually in Developer Mode.Download the Code:Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/stream-detector-pro.gitOr, download the project as a .zip file and extract it.Open Chrome Extensions:Open Google Chrome.Navigate to chrome://extensions.Enable Developer Mode:In the top-right corner of the extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to ON.Load the Extension:Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.Select the folder where you cloned or extracted the project files.Ready to Go!The Stream Detector Pro icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar.
